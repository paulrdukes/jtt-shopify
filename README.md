Just the Text
==============
A Shopify Theme Where Typography is King
----------------------------------------

This is my first Shopify Theme, and it is currently a work in progress. I've currently got a large TODO list going. 

The logo text can be styled using [Lettering.js](https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js/wiki)

The social icons are provided  by [Foundation Icon](http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons). If you check the styles.css.liquid you can get a full list of icons provided.

I'm creating some tutorials that I will post to [my blog](http://www.pauldukes.com) as well the wiki page for this repo. Current topics include adding new fonts and social icons via edits to the CSS and settings pages.

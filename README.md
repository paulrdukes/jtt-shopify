Just the Text
==============
A Shopify Theme Where Typography is King
----------------------------------------

This is my first Shopify Theme, and it is currently a work in progress. I've got a large TODO list going. 

Currently the logo text can be styled using [Lettering.js][https://github.com/davatron5000/Lettering.js/wiki]

The social icons are provided by an icon font. If you check the styles.css.liquid you can get a full list of icons provided.
I'll probably add a quick tutorial in the wiki on how to extend the settings to make other icons available.
